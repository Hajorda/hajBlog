title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous RC
Car Navigation in Dynamic Environments"
description: "This research investigates the application of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) in enabling autonomous RC car
navigation within dynamic environments, specifically focusing
on scenarios without predefined paths. Utilizing MetaDrive as
the primary simulation platform, this study designs, tests, and
benchmarks DRL algorithms, including deep Q-Network (DQN),
double deep Q-Network (DDQN), and Proximal Policy Optimiza-
tion (PPO). The evaluation emphasizes comparative performance
analysis in terms of learning efficiency, adaptability to dynamic
conditions, and overall navigation success. The key components of
this work include reward shaping to optimize training processes.
The findings highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of
each algorithm in navigating complex and dynamic scenarios,
providing information on their potential applications."
